# mediaserver-SIP
A video conferencing server I wrote as my masters. Uses SIP, gstreamer and is written in plain Java

don't expect to much - it was my masters thesis and I did not study CS but Informations- and Communications Technology. 
It's not beautifully coded but it kinda works. Might be useful for someone who wants to get into GStreamer and SIP.
